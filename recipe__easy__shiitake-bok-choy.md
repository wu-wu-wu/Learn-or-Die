* Easy
* 6 to 8 servings  
* 30 minutes

## Ingredients
* 2 pounds baby bok choy
* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 3 small dry red Chinese hot peppers
* 1 pound shiitake mushrooms (about 4 dozen), stems removed
* Salt and pepper
* 4 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 tablespoon grated ginger
* 1 tablespoons sugar
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* 3 tablespoons tamari or soy sauce
* 6 scallions, sliced diagonally, for garnish
* 1 tablespoon roasted sesame seeds for garnish (optional)

## Method
1. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Cut off and discard stem ends of bok choy. Separate leaves, rinse and drain. Drop leaves into boiling water and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until barely cooked. Immediately remove, rinse with cool water, drain and pat dry. Arrange leaves in one layer on an ovenproof earthenware platter, then set aside.
2. Put a large wok or cast-iron skillet over high heat. Add oil and heat until nearly smoking, then add hot peppers and shiitake caps, stirring to coat. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Stir-fry for 2 minutes. Reduce heat slightly and add garlic, ginger, sugar, sesame oil and tamari. Stir-fry for 1 minute more.
3. Spoon shiitake and pan juices over reserved cooked bok choy. Serve at room temperature, or if you prefer, reheat covered with foil for 10 to 15 minutes in a hot oven. Garnish with scallions and sesame seeds, if using.
